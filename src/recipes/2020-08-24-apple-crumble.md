1. For the filling, peel and slice the apples (or peaches, or whatever) into wedges. Mix the sliced fruit with the granulated sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest, and lemon juice.
2. For the crumble topping, put the flour, oats, baking powder, salt, brown sugar, and butter into a bowl.
3. Stir together breaking up the butter until all the pieces of butter are about the size of a pea.
4. Put the filling into a 8x8, or 9x13 baking dish—whatever you have that works. Pour the topping over the filling and spread evenly.
5. Bake for 30-35 minutes at 375 until the topping firms up and the juice from the fruit starts to bubble through.
