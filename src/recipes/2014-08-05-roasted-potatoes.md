## Method
1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Wash the potatoes and halve any of the larger ones so that all the potatoes/pieces are close to equal in size.
2. In a large pot, cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil. Boil for about 10 minutes until the potatoes barely start to get tender.
3. Drain the potatoes, and set aside for a few minutes so that they dry out really well.
4. When they are nice and dry, put the potatoes in a large mixing bowl and add the olive oil, salt, parsley, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Stir everything together really well, dump them on to a large baking sheet, and put them in the oven to roast for about 20 minutes.
5. When the potatoes are nice and brown take them out of the oven and let cool for 10 or so minutes.

## Serving Tips
This is a great side dish for a pot roast or just about any weeknight meal. You can even serve them cold or use them as the base for a nice potato salad.
